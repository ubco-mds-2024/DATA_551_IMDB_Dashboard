**IMDB Dashboard Implementation Report**

### **Overview**
As part of our project, we developed an interactive IMDB Dashboard using Dash, Altair, and Bootstrap. The goal of this project was to analyze and present movie-related data through various visualizations. Our dashboard enables users to explore trends, compare attributes, and gain insights into the impact of different factors on movie success. This report documents the features implemented, challenges encountered, and areas for improvement.

### **Implemented Features**

#### **Data Processing and Cleaning**
To ensure accuracy and usability of the dataset, we performed the following preprocessing steps:
- Loaded movie data from `final_dataset.csv`.
- Selected relevant columns while removing missing values from key numerical fields (`budget`, `grossWorldWide`, `gross_US_Canada`).
- Removed the largest budget value to avoid skewed analysis.
- Converted the `Duration` column from formatted strings (e.g., "2h 30m") into total minutes for better numerical comparison.
- Transformed list-based string values in the `directors`, `writers`, and `stars` columns into readable, comma-separated values.
- Categorized `genres` into broader groups to simplify analysis and visualization.

#### **Dashboard Layout and Functionality**
We structured our dashboard using **Dash Bootstrap Components (DBC)** and divided it into three main sections:
1. **Plots Tab:** Contains scatter plots, histograms, line plots, bar charts, box plots, and pie charts, allowing users to explore movie attributes interactively.
2. **Statistics Tab:** Displays a data table of movies and a ranking chart for top-rated individuals (directors, writers, or stars) within each genre, with user-adjustable filters.
3. **Predictions Tab:** Currently a placeholder for future predictive analytics features.

Each visualization includes dropdown menus for selecting relevant variables, enabling users to customize their analysis.

#### **Visualizations and Insights**
- **Scatter Plot:** Visualizes relationships between two numerical attributes, allowing users to explore correlations (e.g., budget vs. rating).
- **Line Plot:** Highlights trends over time, such as the evolution of movie ratings across years.
- **Histogram:** Shows the distribution of selected numerical attributes.
- **Bar Chart:** Displays average values of selected numerical attributes, grouped by genre.
- **Box Plot:** Illustrates the spread and variability of numerical attributes across different genres.
- **Pie Chart:** Aggregates data by sum, average, or count for numerical attributes, grouped by genre.
- **Top-Rated Individuals Chart:** Identifies the highest-rated directors, writers, or stars within a selected genre, with filtering based on the minimum number of works.

### **Challenges and Areas for Improvement**

#### **Predictions Tab (Not Yet Implemented)**
- The Predictions Tab currently contains placeholder text.
- Future improvements could include:
  - Regression models for predicting movie success based on budget, director, and cast.
  - Improvements of layout, font size and color matching

#### **Advanced Filtering Options**
- The dashboard currently lacks multi-genre filtering and combined filters (e.g., budget range and rating together).
- Users cannot filter by specific directors, writers, or actors beyond the ranking chart.

#### **Performance Optimization**
- The dashboard reloads all charts upon each selection change, causing delays.
- Implementing **client-side caching** or **incremental updates** would improve responsiveness.
- Sorting and additional interactivity features could enhance the ranking chart in the Statistics Tab.

### **Conclusion**
This IMDB Dashboard serves as an effective tool for analyzing movie data through interactive visualizations. While we have successfully implemented essential features, further enhancements in filtering, prediction capabilities, and performance optimization would improve the overall user experience. This project has helped us understand the application of data visualization techniques in real-world datasets, and we look forward to further refining it.
